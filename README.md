 &nbsp;&nbsp;This is basically the entire game. If you wanna install and change some things it`s fine. But the code is in portuguese, at least 90%. Some people encrypt information with aes, I just use brazil language. I will just not show the files in production, generally in the first draft I make some questionable jokes that just after I read one day later I realise that was written in the worst way possible. The actual content used in the game will be show and can be modified.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Actual functionality code would be hard to implement, but I will develop in a way that makes create change content/date more easy. Things like change images, alternative visual novel scripts, change character's internal data will be more easy.
